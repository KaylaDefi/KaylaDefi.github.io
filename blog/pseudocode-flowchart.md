# Weather and Letter Logic – Pseudocode and Flowchart

## by Kayla Sherwood

Posted June 22, 2025

## Explanation

This pseudocode and flowchart illustrate the process of asking a user to enter a letter. Based on the input, we provide different weather outputs:

- If the letter is between **A and E**, we output: `sunny`  
- If the letter is between **J and P**, we output: `cloudy`  
- If the letter is between **Q and X**, we output: `rainy`  
- For any other input, we return: `Not a valid option`

## Pseudocode

**START**  
Prompt user to enter a letter  
Read letter  
Convert letter to uppercase  

IF letter is between 'A' and 'E' THEN  
 Display "sunny"  
ELSE IF letter is between 'J' and 'P' THEN  
 Display "cloudy"  
ELSE IF letter is between 'Q' and 'X' THEN  
 Display "rainy"  
ELSE  
 Display "Not a valid option"  

**END**

## Summary

This exercise demonstrates how to use conditional logic in both pseudocode and flowchart form to guide users through a simple decision-making process. This is a foundational concept in algorithm design and software development.
