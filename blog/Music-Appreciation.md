# 🎶 Creative Appreciation Break: Music Video Inspiration

Sometimes the best ideas come when we step away from scholarly writing and dive into something creative. Here are three music videos that are giving me inspiration right now.

## 🔥 GENER8ION & 070 Shake – *Neo Surf*

This amazing video feels like a cinematic experience. Bold, surreal, and emotionally charged. Definitely makes me want to dance.

## 🌸 Mallrat – *Pavement*

Dreamy and raw, *Pavement* taps into emotional vulnerability and gives space for introspection. A beautiful blend of soft beats and strong lyrics. Good for workouts.

## 🌵 Driveways – *Old Town Road (Pop Punk Cover)*

This cover of *Old Town Road* completely flips the original — blending country-rap with driving guitars and emo edge. Not my favorite Driveways song but the video is funny.
