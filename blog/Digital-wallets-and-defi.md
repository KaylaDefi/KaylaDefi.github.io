# Empowering Participation through Digital Wallets and Decentralized Finance: A Path to Financial Inclusion

## by Kayla Sherwood

_This essay explores how digital wallets and decentralized finance (DeFi) can both enable participation and introduce new risks. Originally written for an academic context in regards to tecnology, society, and global ethics, this piece has been adapted for the blog to help technologists, policymakers, and everyday users think critically about equity and inclusion in the evolving crypto ecosystem._

## Introduction

In a world where traditional financial services are constrained by geography, bureaucracy, or socio-economic status, digital wallets have emerged as pivotal tools that facilitate financial inclusion. When connected to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, these wallets enable users to store, transfer, and invest assets without relying on banks. For many, they represent an opportunity for financial autonomy and global economic participation. Yet, they introduce vulnerabilities and inequities that must be addressed. This paper examines digital wallets and DeFi as both enablers of social justice and sources of new risks. It proposes frameworks and structures to support equitable access and responsible deployment.

As someone who regularly uses digital wallets and decentralized exchanges, I’ve experienced how these technologies offer fast, low-cost access to financial services without relying on traditional banking systems. This everyday use has shaped my understanding of their potential to promote financial inclusion

## Framing

The impact of financial inclusion goes beyond simple access. According to the World Bank (2021), “In developing economies, adults who receive a payment into an account are more likely than the general population to also make digital payments and to save, store, and borrow money.” Although 71% of adults in developing economies have accounts, only 36% receive payments into them; among these, 83% make digital payments, 63% store money, 42% save, and 39% borrow formally. This data demonstrates that inflows creates the foundation for further financial engagement. To fulfill the potential of digital wallets and DeFi, the framing must include digital literacy, infrastructure, and trust-building, not merely the tools themselves.

## Vulnerability

Digital wallets, whether hardware, software, custodial, or MPC-based, expose users, especially those with limited digital literacy, to various risks. Hardware wallets using SECP256K1, like Ledger or Trezor, can be compromised through side-channel attacks that exploit power emissions or electromagnetic leaks (Lemayian et al., 2024). Software wallets often face phishing attempts, malicious extensions, and user interface vulnerabilities that mislead or confuse users (Xia et al., 2024). Custodial solutions may seem safer but introduce centralization and surveillance risks. Non-custodial wallets offer autonomy but require careful key management; losing a seed phrase can mean total loss. Emerging MPC wallets aim to balance security and usability by distributing control of key fragments, but concerns remain about opaque governance and centralized dependencies.

## Distribution

Equitable access to digital wallets and DeFi systems depends on deliberate support structures across social, institutional, and physical levels. Socially, initiatives like community education and digital literacy training are vital in building the foundational knowledge users need to protect themselves and engage meaningfully. Institutionally, frameworks like the Crypto‑asset Operational Risk Management (CORM) model proposed by Roy, Dubey, and Tiwary (2024) offer structured guidance for risk mitigation, including key management protocols, audit standards, and operational oversight aligned with Basel Committee guidelines. Physically, models such as Leaf Global Fintech’s mobile wallet—which functions via feature phones without requiring internet access—demonstrate how preloaded wallet tools and low‑bandwidth mobile access can reach underserved refugee and migrant populations (Leaf Global Fintech, 2021). Effective governance of wallets, especially MPC-based solutions, requires transparency around recovery policies and user access mechanisms. Developing proper regulatory support will help ensure accountability and resilience while encouraging inclusion.

## Learning

The rapid growth of DeFi and digital wallets provides several important lessons. Security must be foundational. Billions of dollars in user losses reflect the consequences of vulnerabilities in smart contracts and wallet infrastructure (Li et al., 2022). Education must go beyond technical walkthroughs, addressing gaps in user awareness and behavioral risk, as many fall victim to scams and fake investment schemes due to limited understanding of wallet vulnerabilities (Kirobo, 2025). Institutions play a crucial role in maintaining trust, and frameworks such as CORM show how formal oversight can mitigate operational risks (Roy et al., 2024). Finally, the regulatory environment must mature to support the safe and inclusive growth of these technologies. Standards like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) enhance transparency, investor protection, and resilience by establishing unified rules for crypto-asset service providers and risk management across EU financial entities (Scorechain, 2024).

## Conclusion

Digital wallets and DeFi have the potential to democratize financial access and support social justice, but these benefits are not automatic. Achieving true inclusion requires a multi-layered approach, starting with secure and usable design, community-based education, and transparent institutional frameworks. Regulatory clarity and infrastructure investments must follow to ensure that the transformative power of these technologies is equitably distributed. Only through deliberate planning and sustained oversight can these tools evolve into systems that empower rather than exclude.
