# Internet Rulings, Laws, and Regulations Affecting Online Privacy

## Introduction

The internet has become a central part of daily life, but with that convenience comes the ongoing concern of protecting personal privacy. As laws attempt to catch up with rapid technological advancements, several key rulings and regulations have emerged to define the limits and responsibilities of digital platforms and governments. This paper will examine three such frameworks: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United States' Fourth Amendment as applied to digital data, and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Each example demonstrates how privacy is treated differently across jurisdictions and populations and offers insight into how legal protections may be improved.

## 1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The GDPR is a European Union regulation that came into effect in 2018 and is widely seen as one of the most comprehensive digital privacy laws globally. It grants EU citizens greater control over their personal data by requiring companies to obtain clear consent for data collection, disclose how data is used, and allow users to access or delete their data.

**Effect on Internet Use:**  
As a user in the United States, I’ve noticed increased use of cookie consent banners and privacy notices—even from companies based outside the EU—due to GDPR’s global reach. These changes have helped increase awareness of how personal data is collected and shared.

**Privacy Protection Assessment:**  
GDPR offers strong protections, including the "right to be forgotten" and strict penalties for non-compliance (Li, Lee, Raghu, & Shi, 2025). However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and many users still accept terms without fully understanding them.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
More standardized and user-friendly interfaces for consent management could strengthen its impact. Additionally, expanding such rights beyond EU borders would benefit global users.

## 2. The Fourth Amendment and Digital Privacy (U.S.)

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Its relevance in the digital age has been challenged and clarified in cases such as *Carpenter v. United States* (2018), where the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement needs a warrant to access cell phone location data.

**Effect on Internet Use:**  
This ruling impacts how I think about app permissions and location services. It shows there is legal acknowledgment that digital data deserves constitutional protection, though it’s limited in scope.

**Privacy Protection Assessment:**  
The ruling is a positive step but applies only to certain types of data and contexts. For example, it does not restrict commercial tracking or metadata collection by private companies.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
Privacy protections could be expanded to include real-time GPS data, browsing history, and data held by third parties. Legislative updates should clarify how digital privacy intersects with existing constitutional rights.

## 3. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

COPPA is a U.S. law that limits the data websites can collect from children under 13. It requires parental consent for data collection and mandates that platforms disclose their data practices.

**Effect on Internet Use:**  
While COPPA does not directly affect me as an adult, it influences platform design and usage—such as limiting comment sections or ad targeting for children's content. It’s also made me more aware of the importance of safeguarding minors online.

**Privacy Protection Assessment:**  
COPPA offers targeted protection for a vulnerable population, but enforcement can be lacking, especially on platforms like YouTube, which faced major fines for violations (McGinley, 2023).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
COPPA should be updated to include protections for teenagers and more robust enforcement mechanisms. It could also mandate simplified, age-appropriate privacy notices.

## Conclusion

While regulations like GDPR, the Fourth Amendment, and COPPA aim to protect users, there are still gaps in coverage and enforcement. Privacy remains an evolving challenge, especially as biometric data, artificial intelligence, and pervasive tracking continue to expand. To ensure a safer online future, laws must be both stronger and more adaptable to new threats.
