# **Futures Trading Simulator**

📅 *Posted on April 9, 2025*

Breakdown:

Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind UI

Core logic: Rust function that computes liquidation price

Rust → WebAssembly: compiled using wasm-pack

Runs in browser: WASM module is loaded dynamically, no server needed

Liquidation logic: simple financial math (entry_price, leverage, maintenance margin)

Reactivity: When user inputs change, React re-calculates and updates UI

## My Commentary

After spending time living vicariously through friends trading perpetual futures contracts, demo trading, and researching these markets, I wanted to make videos that demystify the mechanics and remove some of the hype. It’s easy to get caught up in charts and leverage ratios, but understanding how these tools work is essential to managing risk and making informed decisions.

This led me down a rabbit hole—thinking about not just risk in terms of market volatility, but risk in how we design systems, platforms, and protocols for users. Most people who read my last post weren't sure what MPC stands for. MPC stands for multi-party computation and is a class of cryptographic techniques for computing a function's output without knowing the inputs' original values. This is currently a rich field of research. One major real world application is use in cryptocurrency wallets. As a fan of the sci-fi book *Snow Crash* by Neil Stephenson, I often think about "rat things" and how they are programmed, but that is a different topic for a different day. For now, some research notes.

## **Universally Composable Security (MPC Research Continued)**

Notes from *Universally Composable Security: A New Paradigm for Cryptographic Protocols* by Ran Canetti.

Universal compasability is designed to rigorously model how cryptographic protocols behave in complex, unpredictable environments—especially when multiple protocols are running at once.

Here are a few core ideas that stood out to me:

- **The Environment Is Watching**: The UC model introduces an environment machine—a formal representation of everything outside the protocol (like other protocols, adversaries, or even users). It can interact with the protocol during execution, not just at the start or end. This models real-world scenarios where side-channel attacks, feedback loops, or concurrent activity happen.

- **Ideal vs. Real**: A protocol π UC-realizes a function *f* if no environment can distinguish between π (run with a real-world adversary) and an ideal process (with a trusted party and a simulator). This is a much stronger guarantee than traditional definitions.

- **Universal Composition**: The UC theorem says if protocol π securely realizes an ideal functionality *f*, then any system that uses *f* as a subroutine can safely replace it with π—even in messy, concurrent, adversarial settings. 

- **Reactive Functionalities & Adaptive Inputs**: UC handles protocols where inputs and outputs evolve over time—key for trading platforms or smart contracts where one action influences the next.

- **Implications**: This approach offers a formal blueprint for building secure, composable cryptographic systems—whether that’s for privacy-preserving identity, multi-party computation, or financial primitives in DeFi.

If you’re interested in the theoretical side of security—and how it connects to building safer financial tools—stay tuned for more articles covered in the future.
