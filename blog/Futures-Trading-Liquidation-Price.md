# Futures Trading Simulator - Calculating and understanding liquidation price

üìÖ *Posted on April 9, 2025*

I built a crypto futures trading simulator that calculates the liquidation price based on the user‚Äôs entry price, leverage, and position type (long or short). The core logic is written in Rust for speed and reliability, and it's compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) so it runs directly in the browser. My Next.js + TypeScript frontend loads the WASM module, takes user inputs, and displays the calculated liquidation price in real time.

Breakdown:

Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind UI

Core logic: Rust function that computes liquidation price

Rust ‚Üí WebAssembly: compiled using wasm-pack

Runs in browser: WASM module is loaded dynamically, no server needed

Liquidation logic: simple financial math (entry_price, leverage, maintenance margin)

Reactivity: When user inputs change, React re-calculates and updates UI

## Key Concepts Covered

In this video, I walk you through the process of creating a futures trading simulator using Rust, WebAssembly, Next.js, and React. The app currently calculates the liquidation price for futures trades, but I plan to enhance it with live Bitcoin price updates and a dashboard for open trades. I also explain the core logic behind the calculations and the importance of understanding the concept of liquidation. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback on the current setup!

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Commentary

After spending time living vicariously through friends trading perpetual futures contracts, demo trading on CoinCatch, and researching these markets, I wanted to make videos that demystify the mechanics and remove some of the hype. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in charts and leverage ratios, but understanding **how** these tools work is essential to managing risk and making informed decisions.

This led me down a rabbit hole‚Äîthinking about not just risk in terms of market volatility, but risk in how we design systems, platforms, and protocols for users.

## üîê On Universally Composable Security (MPC Research Continued)

Inspired by Ran Canetti‚Äôs paper, *Universally Composable Security: A New Paradigm for Cryptographic Protocols*.

Universal compasability is designed to rigorously model how cryptographic protocols behave in complex, unpredictable environments‚Äîespecially when multiple protocols are running at once.

Here are a few core ideas that stood out to me:

‚Ä¢ The Environment Is Watching: The UC model introduces an environment machine‚Äîa formal representation of everything outside the protocol (like other protocols, adversaries, or even users). It can interact with the protocol during execution, not just at the start or end. This models real-world scenarios where side-channel attacks, feedback loops, or concurrent activity happen.

‚Ä¢ Ideal vs. Real: A protocol œÄ UC-realizes a function f if no environment can distinguish between œÄ (run with a real-world adversary) and an ideal process (with a trusted party and a simulator). This is a much stronger guarantee than traditional definitions.

‚Ä¢ Universal Composition: The UC theorem says if protocol œÄ securely realizes an ideal functionality F, then any system that uses F as a subroutine can safely replace it with œÄ‚Äîeven in messy, concurrent, adversarial settings. That‚Äôs modularity with real-world teeth.

‚Ä¢ Reactive Functionalities & Adaptive Inputs: UC handles protocols where inputs and outputs evolve over time‚Äîkey for trading platforms or smart contracts where one action influences the next.

‚Ä¢ Implications: This approach offers a formal blueprint for building secure, composable cryptographic systems‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs for privacy-preserving identity, multi-party computation, or financial primitives in DeFi.

If you‚Äôre interested in the theoretical side of security‚Äîand how it connects to building safer financial tools‚Äîstay tuned for more articles covered in the future.
